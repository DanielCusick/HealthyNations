### HealthyNations Linear Regression
This is a dataset and model I built in Fall 2023 as part of a paper on the potential impact of single payer health care in the United States. All data is from [stats.oecd.org](https://stats.oecd.org/). [This analysis  from the CommonWealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2019/apr/considering-single-payer-proposals-lessons-from-abroad) informed my classification of the countries included. 

**health16.csv** is the final data table. At the outset of the project, I set out exploring and assembled the table piece-by-piece. Future work could consider more eleganlty coding the construction of the data table. A function for imputation of mean by country would likely make sense, for example.  

Selected variables and a snapshot of the results from the **Single Payer Regression Script.R** are summarized on **[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/DanielCusick/1153552)** and in the **Single Payer Slides Summary.pdf** file.
